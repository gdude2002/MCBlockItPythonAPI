This is the official Python API for interfacing with http://mcblock.it

Please note: For the majority of the API functions, you will need an API key.
You can get one by creating as server over at http://mcblock.it

Installation
============

In the directory you downloaded the files to, just do:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

Usage
=====

Using the API is pretty simple.
The first thing you'll want to do is import the API and create an instance of it.
You will only need an API key if you're doing anything that isn't a user lookup.

```python
from mcblockit import MCBlockItAPI

handler = MCBlockItAPI(api_key)
```
